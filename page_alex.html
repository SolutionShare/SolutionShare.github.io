    <div>Hi, My name is Alex Nishimwe, I am a student at the University of Ottawa in Software Engineering program.
    	 Indeed, I gained a passion for programming at the university because before I had ever programmed.
         However, with a group of other university students, we decided to create a page called"Solution share",
         and the goal of the page is to help students seeking exercises's solutions of their course.
         So I took it as a great idea from my team and so, we've started developping it.</div>

    I am a first year student in software engineering at the University of Ottawa. I personally believe that
    software is the future. A good program is alway useful, be it in a hospital to keep the information of patients
    safe or for people to help each other through services like Wikipedia. This is why I am very motivated by
    SolutionShare and hope you will all participate!</div>

	I'm Maxime, a first year student in the software engeneering program at the University of Ottawa. For our class,
	we had to come up with an original idea for a product, and as students, we thought of of a product to help out 
	other students. I've always liked playing around with softwares and minor coding, and this project allowed me to
	explore website coding more than I had before, and it was so fun. However, not all classes go well, which is why
	it's great to have access to answers to problems we do while studying. That was the goal of our project: 
	SolutionShare, a website to share our answers with other students and help each other out.</div>

	Im chris, a first year software engineering student at the university of ottawa. I am one of the
	developers of Solution Share and my job is to make your learning easier. I have been programing for
	4 years and I have to say that I love it. I began programing when I was anoyed at doing constant math
	problems, so instead of complaing I wrote a basic program to do it for me. Even now, we have created 
	this website to now make your lives easier to, with solutions just one click away.</div>
