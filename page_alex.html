    <div>Hello, My name is Alex Nishimwe, I am a student at the University of Ottawa in Software Engineering program.</div>
    <div>Indeed, I gained a passion for programming at the university because before I had ever programmed.</div>
    <div>However, with a group of other university students, we decided to create a page called "share solution",</div>
    <div>and the goal of the page is to help students seeking exercises's solutions of their course.</div>
    <div>So I took it as a great idea from my team and so, we've started developping it.</div>
