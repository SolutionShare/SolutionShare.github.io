         I am a student at the University of Ottawa in Software Engineering program.
    	 Indeed, I gained a passion for programming at the university because before I had ever programmed.
         However, with a group of other university students, we decided to create a page called"Solution share",
         and the goal of the page is to help students seeking exercises's solutions of their course.
         So I took it as a great idea from my team and so, we've started developping it."

    I am a first year student in software engineering at the University of Ottawa. I personally believe that

    SolutionShare and hope you will all participate!"

		I'm Maxime, a first year student in the software engeneering program at the University of Ottawa. For our class,
		we had to come up with an original idea for a product, and as students, we thought of of a product to help out 
		other students. I've always liked playing around with softwares and minor coding, and this project allowed me to
		explore website coding more than I had before, and it was so fun. However, not all classes go well, which is why
		it's great to have access to answers to problems we do while studying. That was the goal of our project: 
		SolutionShare, a website to share our answers with other students and help each other out."
