		<h3>Search by manual</h3><br></br>
		<img class="feature" src="Pictures/TempFeatureImage1.png"><br></br>
		<p>
		SolutionShare offers a quick search by manual.<br>
		All that's required is the manual's name or code.<br>
		Once the manual is found, a list of the manual's available problem numbers will be shown.<br>
		Select the wanted solution from the list of problem numbers and enjoy.<br>
		The more precise the informations entered in the search, the faster the solution is found.
		</p><br></br>

		<h3>Search by subject</h3><br></br>
		<img class="feature" src="Pictures/TempFeatureImage2.png"><br></br>
		<p>
		SolutionShare offers a search alternative, by subject.<br>
		The subject can be searched if the manual's name or code is unknown.<br>
		The result will be shown as categories of diferent subjects thought in school.<br>
		The manual can then be found using the categories, or sub-categories.<br>
		This allows the user to find solutions even without a manual.

	<div class="feature"><center>
		<h3>Search by university course</h3><br></br>
		<img class="feature" src="Pictures/TempFeatureImage3.png"><br></br>
		<p>
		The final method of search uses a university course's code.<br>
		The code will find the universities using the searched code from which to choose.<br>
		After selecting the correct university, the course's assigned manuals will be listed.<br>
		Simply select the manual and look for the wanted solution.<br>
		Some codes may not work due to not having been added or simply lacking the manuals on SolutionShare.

		<h3>Like and dislike system</h3><br></br>
		<img class="feature" src="Pictures/TempFeatureImage4.png"><br></br>
		<p>
		The user system will include likes and dislikes.<br>
		This way, popular solutions will be highlighted.<br>
		The most coherent and complete solution can be easier to find this way.<br>
		Finally, the user with the most likes will appear in the top 10 posters, updated weekly.<br>
		This top 10 will provide a sense of trust to the solution searchers, and pride tto the posters.

		<h3>Video solutions</h3><br></br>
		<img class="feature" src="Pictures/TempFeatureImage5.png"><br></br>
		<p>
		SolutionShare will also include video solutions.<br>
		When in the posting solution page as a user, a video option will be shown.<br>
		Once clicked, it will ask to either record a video live, or browse documents.<br>
		It allows a fun alternative for people having time to explain their process.<br>
		The video's lenght will be restricted to not have hourlong solutions to a single problem.<br>

	<div class="feature"><center>
		<h3>Demands system</h3><br></br>
		<img class="feature" src="Pictures/TempFeatureImage6.png"><br></br>
		<p>
		If a solution isn't in the databank, the demand system comes in.<br>
		Users can make requests to have solutions added.<br>
		The requests will appear in the page to access the solution posting.<br>
		This way, an active poster will know which solutions are in demand by other users.<br>
		The poster can then add the requested solutions if they want and surely collect lots of likes.
