		The subject can be searched if the manual's name or code is unknown. 
		The result will be shown as categories of diferent subjects thought in school.

		<img class="feature" src="Pictures/TempFeatureImage3.png"><br></br>
		<p class="feature">
		The last method of search uses the university course code. 
		The code will find and display the universities using it to choose from. 
		After selecting the correct university, the course's assigned manuals will be listed. 
		Simply select the manual and look for the wanted solution. 
		Some codes may not work due to not having been added or simply lacking the manuals on SolutionShare.
