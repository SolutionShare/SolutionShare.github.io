		<h3 class="feature">Search by manual</h3><br></br>
		<img class="feature" src="Pictures/ImageFeature1.png"><br></br>
		<p class="feature">
		SolutionShare offers a quick search by manual. 
		All that is required is the manual's name or code. 
		Once the manual is found, a list of the manual's available problem numbers will be shown. 
		Select the wanted solution from the list of problem numbers and enjoy. 
		The more precise the informations entered in the search, the faster the solution is found.

		<h3 class="feature">Search by subject</h3><br></br>
		<img class="feature" src="Pictures/ImageFeature2.png"><br></br>
		<p class="feature">
		SolutionShare offers an alternative search option, by subject. 
		The subject can then be searched if the manual's name or code is unknown. 
		The result will be shown as categories of diferent subjects thought in school. 
		The manual can be found using the categories, or sub-categories, by clicking on them.

		<h3 class="feature">Search by university course</h3><br></br>
		<img class="feature" src="Pictures/ImageFeature3.png"><br></br>
		<p class="feature">
		The last method of search uses the university course code. 
		The code will find and display the universities using it. 
		After selecting the correct university, the university course's assigned manuals will be listed. 
		Simply select the manual and look for the wanted solution. 
		Some codes may not work due to not having been added or simply lacking the manuals on SolutionShare.

	<div class="feature"><center>
		<h3 class="feature">Like and dislike system</h3><br></br>
		<img class="feature" src="Pictures/ImageFeature4.png"><br></br>
		<p class="feature">
		The user system will include likes and dislikes. 
		This way, popular solutions will be highlighted. 
		The most coherent and complete solution will be easier to find as they will most likely be popular. 
		The user with the most likes will appear in the top 10 posters, updated weekly. 
		This top 10 will provide a sense of trust to the solution searchers, and pride for the posters.

	<div class="feature"><center>
		<h3 class="feature">Video solutions</h3><br></br>
		<img class="feature" src="Pictures/ImageFeature5.png"><br></br>
		<p class="feature">
		SolutionShare will also include video solutions. 
		When in the posting solution page as a user, a video option will be shown. 
		Once clicked, it will ask to either record a video live, or browse documents. 
		It allows a fun alternative for people having time to explain their process. 
		The video's lenght will be restricted to avoid having hourlong solutions to a single problem. 
		</p><br></br>

	<div class="feature"><center>
		<h3 class="feature">Demands system</h3><br></br>
		<img class="feature" src="Pictures/ImageFeature6.png"><br></br>
		<p class="feature">
		If a solution isn't in the databank, the demand system comes in. 
		Users can make requests to have solutions added. 
		The requests will appear in the page to access the solution posting. 
		This way, an active poster will know which solutions are in demand by other users. 
		The poster can then add the requested solutions if they want and surely collect lots of likes.
