    <div>
        <h3> Our Goal</h3>
        <p>Like our slogan infers, we offer solution made by students in hopes off helping other struggling students. Oftentimes, school textbooks offer short and 
           unhelpful answers, if they provide any. Here, at Solutionshare, we think that no one understands a student better than a fellow student, so we built a 
           platform where students can share their solutions to different textbook's exercises and you do not need to spend a dime to help or get help, we know student life is hard.

        <h3> How we keep the site up and running</h3>
        <p>Running a big database with a social aspect isn't easy, so we need some money. Once again, you don't have to pay. Most of our revenue will come from simple adds on the
           side when you're looking for solutions. We do also accept donations, and 100% of the money given will go towards the website's infrastructure, nothing goes into our pockets.
