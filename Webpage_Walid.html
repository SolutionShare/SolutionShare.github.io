        <h3> Our Goal</h3>
        <p>Like our slogan says, we offer solution made by students in hope to help other strugguling students. Often times, school textbooks offer short and 
            unhelpfull answers, if they provide any. Here at solutionshare, we think that no one understands a student better than a fellow students, so built 
            a plateform so that students can share the solutions and you do not need to spend a dime to help or get help, we know student life is hard.

        <h3> How SolutionShare works</h3>
        <p>To get started, you simply need to quickly <a href="file:///C:/Users/walid/Desktop/git/SolutionShare.github.io/temporary_link_walid.html">sign up</a>. 
           You then can either post solutions, which we highly encourage, by uploading a picture and
           giving a few informations about where it’s from or you can start looking for the answer you need. There more information on our 
           <a href="file:///C:/Users/walid/Desktop/git/SolutionShare.github.io/temporary_link_walid.html">features page</a>. 
           Also, we very much want to enphasize the fact that we want solution by students, we do not support copyright infrengemnt at solutionshare, so please,
           only share your own work, we konw you’re smart!
