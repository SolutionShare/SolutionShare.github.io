Simple iconography, no 3D ou shades, keeping in the mind the overall goal of the website, which is a calm and simple feel.
Typography
==========
We will be using lobster from Google Fonts for all headings.
Rubik for all other text.

Links

Links in the navigation bar will not be inderlined. All other links will blue (same color as navbar).  Visited links will be a darker shade of blue.

When hovering on the logo, a text box appears to make it clear it's "clicable".
